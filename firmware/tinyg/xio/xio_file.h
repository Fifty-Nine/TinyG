/*--- How to setup and use program memory "files" ----

  Setup a memory file (OK, it's really just a string)
  should be declared as so:

	const char g0_test1[] PROGMEM= "\
	g0 x10 y20 z30\n\
	g0 x0 y21 z-34.2";

	Line 1 is the initial declaration of the array (string) in program memory
	Line 2 is a continuation line. 
		- Must end with a newline and a continuation backslash
		- (alternately can use a semicolon instead of \n is XIO_SEMICOLONS is set)
		- Each line will be read as a single line of text using fgets()
	Line 3 is the terminating line. Note the closing quote and semicolon.


  Initialize: xio_pgm_init() must be called first. See the routine for options.

  Open the file: xio_pgm_open() is called, like so:
	xio_pgm_open(PGMFILE(&g0_test1));	// simple linear motion test

	PGMFILE does the right cast. If someone more familiar with all this 
	can explain why PSTR doesn't work I'd be grateful.

  Read a line of text. Example from parsers.c
	if (fgets(textbuf, BUF_LEN, srcin) == NULL) {	
		printf_P(PSTR("\r\nEnd of file encountered\r\n"));
		clearerr(srcin);
		srcin = stdin;
		tg_prompt();
		return;
	}
