/* Xmega Non Volatile Memory functions
 *
 * Ahem. Before you waste days trying to figure out why none of this works
 * in the simulator, you should realize that IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE WINAVR
 * SIMULATOR (now I'll calm down now.).
 *
 * Then before you waste more time figuring out why it doesn't work AT ALL,
 * realize that there is a serious bug in the xmega A3 processor family.
 * This is documented in Atmel release note AVR1008 and in the chip Errata.
 * This file contains workarounds to those problems.
 *
 * Some code was incorporated from the avr-xboot project:
 *	https://github.com/alexforencich/xboot
 *	http://code.google.com/p/avr-xboot/wiki/Documentation
 *
 * These refs were also helpful:
 *	http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=669385

/***************************************************************************
 *
 * XMEGA EEPROM driver source file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator
 *		definitions for various configuration parameters for the
 *		XMEGA EEPROM driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code,
 *		since most functions are just a few lines of code, and the
 *		function call overhead would decrease code performance. The driver
 *		is intended for rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for
 *		getting started with the XMEGA EEPROM module.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call (or just inline the functions, bonehead).
 *
 *		Besides which, it doesn't work in the simulator, so how would
 *		you ever know?
 *
 * Notes:
 *      See AVR1315: Accessing the XMEGA EEPROM + Code eeprom_driver.c /.h

/*
 * EEPROM_WriteString() - write string to EEPROM; may span multiple pages
 *
 *	This function writes a character string to IO mapped EEPROM.
 *	If memory mapped EEPROM is enabled this function will not work.
 *	This functiom will cancel all ongoing EEPROM page buffer loading
 *	operations, if any.
 *
 *	A string may span multiple EEPROM pages. For each affected page it:
 *		- loads the page buffer from EEPROM with the contents for that page
 *		- writes the string bytes for that page into the page buffer
 *		- performs an atomic write for that page (erase and write)
 *		- does the next page until the string is complete.
 *
 *	If 'terminate' is TRUE, add a null to the string, if FALSE, don't.
 *
 *	Note that only the page buffer locations that have been copied into
 *	the page buffer (during string copy) will be affected when writing to
 *	the EEPROM (using AtomicPageWrite). Page buffer locations that have not
 *	been loaded will be left untouched in EEPROM.
 *
 *	  address 	 must be between 0 and top-of-EEPROM (0x0FFF in a 256 or 192)
 *	  string 	 must be null-terminated
 *	  terminate	 set TRUE to write string termination NULL to EEPROM
 *				 set FALSE to not write NULL (useful for writing "files")
 *
 *	  returns pointer to next EEPROM location past the last byte written
 *
 *	Background: The xmega EEPROM is rated at 100,000 operations (endurance).
 *	The endurance figure is dominated by the erase operation. Reads do not
 *	affect the endurance and writes have minimal effect. Erases occur at
 *	the page level, so a strategy to minimize page erases is needed. This
 *	function is a reasonably high endurance solution since erases only occur
 *	once for each time a string crosses a page, as opposed to once per byte
 *	written (as in EEPROM_WriteByte()). A slightly higher endurance solution
 *	would be to store up multiple contiguous string writes and perform them
 *	as single page operations.
