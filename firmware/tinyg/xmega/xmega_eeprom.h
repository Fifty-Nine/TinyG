/*************************************************************************
 *
 * XMEGA EEPROM driver header file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator 
 *		definitions for various configuration parameters for the 
 *		XMEGA EEPROM driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, 
 *		since most functions are just a few lines of code, and the 
 *		function call overhead would decrease code performance. The driver
 *		is intended for rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for 
 *		getting started with the XMEGA EEPROM module.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 * Notes:
 *      See AVR1315: Accessing the XMEGA EEPROM + Code eeprom_driver.c /.h
